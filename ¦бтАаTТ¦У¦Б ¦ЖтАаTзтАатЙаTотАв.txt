Explanation of each point

Save all elements you need. For example, education = document.getElementById("education") or skills = document.getElementsByClassName("skills")

Create a function `calculate` by using arrows (ES6 arrow function). Inside your function, you should:

(1) Declare a variable `name` with "let". You will need it later when you will create a JS object

(2) Declare a variable `price` with "let". The value you must get from the input `starting bid`. Don't forget to turn it into a number. By default, it's a string!

Your calculator must work only if name is not empty AND price is not empty (use conditions with logical operators here)

(3) Each option of your dropdown list for education should contain an attribute "value". It must be equal to the coefficient. For example:

<select id="education">
<option value="1.5">Undergraduate degree</option>

</select>

You can use the following selector --> education.value. It will return the coefficient that you can then multiply with your starting bid! Don't forget to turn it into a number. By default, it's a string!

(4) Same as (3)

(5) Try to use array.reduce here. I will share an example.

(6) Try to use array.forEach here. I will share an example.

(7) Try to use for loop here. I will share an example

(8) Create a text space to express your love

Save everything as an object with 3 properties (name, price, and love letter). For example

let person = {

bride_name: name,

bride_price: price,

letter_to_bride: love_letter

}

Add Event Listener to your button (don't use onClick in html)

Your calculator must display the bride's/groom's name, his/her price, and your love letter on the same page as your calculator. Use template strings here (`Your price for ${bride_name} is etc.). You should put the object properties inside of your template string!



Your JavaScript code must include at least 1 of the following things

1. array.forEach method

2. array.reduce method

3. const/let

4. conditionals

5. logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)

6. function composition. Remember f(g(x))

7. ES6 template string (`Like this ${variable})

8. ES6 arrow functions

9. object

10. for loop

Evaluation

I will evaluate your assignment based on the following criteria

1. HTML - 5%

2. JavaScript - 90%

3. Github availability - 5%
